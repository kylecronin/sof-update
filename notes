I need to parse multiple sources of information to present the answers section.

How to do this?

Obviously, the view should only get a final data structure that indicates what's supposed to be shown
it will be an array of arrays, each sub-array containing the following data:

oldscore
newscore
oldans
newans
link
text

as you can see, computing the diff and determining if it will be shown at all are decisions made by the
view, as well as general ordering. all we need to do is to dump the data into an array and the view
should take care of the rest.

actually, this brings up another point to separate concerns. what I could do is have one function
extract the data from the source and another to get the corresponding data from the db.

function read
- takes input source
- returns array of (id, score, ans, text) for each answer

function addpast
- takes array of (id, score, ans, text)
- returns (id, newscore, oldscore, newacc, oldacc, text)
